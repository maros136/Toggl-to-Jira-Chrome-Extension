# Toggl-to-Jira-Chrome-Extension
Sync toggl time entries with Jira work log


Converts Toggl time entries to *Work Log* entries on corresponding Jira tasks where Time Tracking has been enabled.
If your Project requires you to log work on Jira tasks and issues, it is not possible to import from Toggl. Server side Toggl-Jira integrations cost money or won't work in the cloud. This extension bridges the gap.

This simple extension allows you to post your Toggl entries to the corresponding Jira tasks automatically. All you need to do is include the Jira issue identifier at the beginning of your Toggl descriptions, eg; "ABC-123 I did some work".

You need to be logged in to your Jira board, so the cookies are available in the browser, and provide your Toggl User API Key which is available here; https://toggl.com/app/profile

Configure your Jira server URL and Toggl API Key in the extension Options once installed.
